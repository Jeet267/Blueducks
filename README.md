No external CSS dependencies

Dynamic styling capabilities

Easy component-specific style management

Future Improvements
Add responsive design for mobile devices

Implement actual product data from an API

Add interactive elements (hover effects, animations)

Create a functional search feature

Implement routing for different pages
